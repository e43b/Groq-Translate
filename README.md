## Instructions for Use

### 1. Create an Account and Obtain an API Key

First, create your account to obtain a Groq API key: [Groq Login](https://console.groq.com/login)

After registering, access: [Get Key](https://console.groq.com/keys)

Here, you can create a new API key. After that, copy your key and click "done". It is important that you do not share this key with anyone, as someone with access to it can use your key, resulting in the consumption of your limit without your knowledge.

### 2. Site Configuration

Visit the [Groq-Translate](https://e43b.github.io/Groq-Translate/) site, enter your API key, and click the green "Save API Key" button to avoid adding it each time you use the site. Don't worry, the site won't capture this information. If you want to run the site on your machine, just clone the code from the [gh-pages branch](https://github.com/e43b/Groq-Translate/tree/gh-pages).

If you added a key and want to delete it, simply click the red button labeled "Delete Saved API Key".

### 3. Model Selection and Translation

Select one of the five different models currently available. Each has its peculiarities, so we recommend testing them to see which works best for your translation needs.

To translate a text, enter the word or phrase you want to translate, the original language, and the language you want to translate to.

For phrases, the model will:
- Translate the phrase
- Provide translation variations
- Suggest phrases with similar meanings

Remember that the AI model's response can vary greatly depending on the phrase and the model, so it's important to test.

- Provide synonyms
- Suggest similar words
- Display example sentences using the word

### 4. Translation History

By accessing the [Translation History](https://e43b.github.io/Groq-Translate/#historico) link, you can view all your past translations on the site. You can search for terms you translated or were responded to by the model, filter by translations made with specific models, and organize from newest to oldest or vice versa, allowing you to review old translations and compare models without making a new request.
